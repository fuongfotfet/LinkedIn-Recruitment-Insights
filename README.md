# LinkedIn-Recruitment-Insights

## Overview
This project was developed during my internship at Vietcombank as a **Data Analyst**, focusing on analyzing talent gaps in Vietnam's largest bank, particularly within the **IT and Data teams**.

Additionally, I built a **CV Scanner App** powered by **Gemini Pro** to streamline the hiring process.
